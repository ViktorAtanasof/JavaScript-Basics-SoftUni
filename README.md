# JS Basics course

The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills necessary for all technology majors. This includes writing entry-level programming code
(basic coding skills), working with a **Development Environment (IDE)**, using variables and data, 
operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using of conditional constructions (if, if-else)
and loops (for, while, do-while).
